    "\n",
    "Estimation statistics refers to the process of estimating an unknown quantity of interest based on the information available in a sample.\n",
    "There are two types of estimates: point estimates and interval estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate an unknown parameter.\n",
    "For example, if we want to estimate the population mean, we might use the sample mean as our point estimate. \n",
    "The sample mean is a point estimate because it provides a single value that represents our best guess of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate is a range of values within which the true value of the parameter is likely to fall. \n",
    "This range is calculated based on the sample data and is typically accompanied by a level of confidence or probability. \n",
    "For example, we might say that we are 95% confident that the true population mean falls within a certain interval, say (2.5, 3.5). \n",
    "This interval estimate provides a range of values that we believe contains the true population mean with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, estimation statistics involves using sample data to estimate an unknown population parameter, with the goal of obtaining either a point estimate or an interval estimate.\n",
    "A point estimate provides a single value, while an interval estimate provides a range of values within which the true value of the parameter is likely to fall."
